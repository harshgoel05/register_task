## Introduction

We talk of digital India, we think of cashless transactions, smart systems but not healthcare. So we are trying to digitalize healthcare by proving each person a digital health identity number.

*How will it help?* 
Doctors can easily access health report cards and scores of an individual, No need to maintain thick files with all prescriptions, etc.

There is a lack of connection between the doctor community which in turn leads to delays and compromise in the quality of treatment for the patients. And during these days of pandemics, there seems to be a **dire need to connect the health community virtually**. We focus to connect doctors on an online platform where they can network, share knowledge and help each other to cure better.

**“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”**
*These lines from Hellen Keller define the power of a community.*

But what if we merge the superpower of our excellent medical staff and their community.
This is exactly what we are aiming to, presenting you, **Physc**.
